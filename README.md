# HTTP API Client (hapic)

A Rust crate for quickly creating nice-to-use client libraries for HTTP APIs, in particular, there's
lots of tooling around HTTP JSON APIs.

**This is still a work in progress.**

## Examples

For examples with an explanation, see the crate documentation.

For a complete client, see the `cloudconvert` crate.

## Tests

For the tests, you need to be running [./test-api-server](./test-api-server) (just use `cargo run`).

Then, just use `cargo test` within [./hapic](./hapic).
